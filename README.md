# Neural-Network
IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING FASHION MNIST
It consists of Neural Network using MNIST dataset to classify images into 10 categories like Tshirt,Boots,Trouser and some more.
Uses Multi layer Classification,predicts the correct output with accuracy more than 90%.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS USING NEURAL NETWORK(california housing dataset)
Creating model with input,hidden and output layers first using Sequential Method then using Functional API method.

Model can be savd and restored later
Using callbacks during training

DATA PREPROCESSING
Onre of the most important step while Applying Machine Learning algoritms is data preprocessing such as missing values imputation,conversion of categorical var to numeric var,removing useless variables and so on.Hence this code.
